This vehicle assembler helps facilitate searching for vehicles in instances. This project was built to use as a search. It builds the type of vehicle you need and and searches the vehicle. Based on this information, will towing the vehicle be applicable? This will allow users to save time in search for a vehicle and the capability of it. In this project, I learned the specificity of each procedure. It was necessary to learn how to create each vehicle and then apply actions to each vehicle.
