# Motor-Vehicle-Assembler

## Description

This vehicle assembler helps facilitate searching for vehicles in instances. This project was built to use as a search. It builds the type of vehicle you need and and searches the vehicle. Based on this information, will towing the vehicle be applicable? This will allow users to save time in search for a vehicle and the capability of it. In this project, I learned the specificity of each procedure. It was necessary to learn how to create each vehicle and then apply actions to each vehicle.

## Installation

These will be the following downloads/ installations that will be necessary. For starters, these libraries will need to be downloaded onto your computer. VS Code, or some sort of code editor, will need to be downloaded as well. Inside the code editor, you will need the Inquirer package downloaded. Running "npm i" in the command terminal will install all the node modules you will need. 

## Usage

In order for this project to work properly, you will need to download the libraries onto your local device for use with your code editor. In the code editor, you will open up a terminal and begin installing the node modules. To begin using the application type "npm run start" into the terminal. You will begin with a question to choose from an existing vehicle or to create a new vehicle. After this, you will be redirected to different prompts. Each line will ask you a new prompt according to previous response.

## Tests

This should begin running the application. The first question below will show up in the terminal:
    ![Initial vehicle selection](assets/images/Initial%20Prompt.png)

Once you choose a vehicle, it redirect to a following question. The picture below is demonstating with the choice of an already exising vehicle:
    ![Following Prompts](assets/images/Following%20Prompt.png)

This is just demonstrating some of the initial prompts that will show up. With each selection made, you will be redirected to a new prompt until you would like to exit.
